The task was to clone the Bonsai Pricing website using HTML and CSS only.

1) Navbar with Hover Effect:- The navbar i created includes a hover effect where, upon hovering, a dropdown box opens. This was achieved using CSS positioning and display properties.

2) Buttons in the Navbar:- Two buttons were added to the navbar, serving as navigation elements for the website.

3) Nested Buttons using Flexbox:- Within the website content, i utilized Flexbox to create three nested buttons. This layout provides a visually appealing and organized display of options or features.

4) Pricing Cards: Three pricing cards were implemented, presenting different pricing options. These cards showcase the pricing details, including the cost and features offered.

5) Pricing Per Month Information: Below the pricing cards, i included three cards displaying pricing information per month. These cards provide an additional overview of the pricing structure.

6) Frequently Asked Questions :- Below the pricing cards, an accordion-style section was created to most frequently asked questions. This allows users to expand and collapse questions and answers for a better user experience.In that i used flax padding and postion property to set the img.

7) Help and Customer Support: Multiple divs were utilized to display information such as "Need help? We'll be right with you." This section highlights the availability and helpfulness of the customer support team.

8) Get Started and Free Trial: Another div was created to emphasize the call-to-action, encouraging users to "Get started in 30 seconds" and highlighting a "Free trial for 7 days." This section i create using flax box to center the information inside it.

9) Footer Section: Lastly, a footer was added to the website, providing additional information and navigation links. Again i used flax box to set all anchar tag in colums. Using flex-direction: column.
